# horizon_scripts
Check out [vaughan's gist](https://github.com/hilts-vaughan/hilts-vaughan.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2022-12-16-installing-horizon-xi-linux.md#install-horizonxi---steam-play-steam-deck--other-systems) for the step-by-step instructions.

[Matty's Guide](https://github.com/MattyGWS/HorizonXI-Linux-Installation) is another good guide and he's faster/more available to support if there are any issues in the Steam deck thread.  Probably the most followed guide as of 10/28/2024.

Script seems to be broken atm. too busy to investigate. use a manual method.
