# horizon_scripts
Check out [vaughan's gist](https://github.com/hilts-vaughan/hilts-vaughan.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2022-12-16-installing-horizon-xi-linux.md#install-horizonxi---steam-play-steam-deck--other-systems) for the step-by-step instructions.

This script should:
- see if you don't have the base game downloaded & extracted
- attempt to download/install v1.0.1
- provide directions to add the steam shortcut
- after files are downloaded & extracted and the steam shortcut added, the next time you launch update-horizon.sh it should upgrade to the latest


Just download this script, and run like so in konsole:

```
./update-horizon.sh
```

For any update after the first you can copy to your desktop and run it with double click.
